Title: Sanloup as cited by Taylor et al. (2014)
Title: Temperature input in Celsius, output in Kelvin
Title: Pressure in bar
Title: P-T are overwritten by those in the environment variable file
Title: log fo2 Path can be -9FMQ to +3FMQ, IW, NNO, HM, ABS[OLUTE], NONE
Title: log fo2 Delta can be any float number
Title: It may help to remove K2O and / or Cr2O3 lines
Title: Any NiO, MnO and CoO lines should be removed for pMELTS calculations
Title: The effect of including CO2, SO3, Cl2O, F2O is unpredictable and is not recommended
Title: Fractionate: phase for selective fractionation
Title: Use table file to generate MELTS inputs along the P,T profile from ExoCcycleGeo
Title: One row per P,T[,fO2] condition, column headers: Temperature, Pressure, logfO2
Title: fO2 could deal with redox changes upon ascent a la Gaillard and Scaillet 2007 
Title: May need to remove corresponding values in the env file.
